    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A great holiday ham glaze needs to have three things: wonderful flavor, 
        gorgeous, shiny appearance, and a crispy, crackling crust you can hear
         across the room. I'm happy to report this easy-to-make glaze has all those
         things in abundance.</p>
