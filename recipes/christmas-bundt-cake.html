    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A great holiday ham glaze needs to have three things: wonderful flavor, 
        gorgeous, shiny appearance, and a crispy, crackling crust you can hear
         across the room. I'm happy to report this easy-to-make glaze has all those
         things in abundance.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 whole star anise</li>
        <li>12 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (7 pound) country-style ham</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 1/2teaspoons freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour water, star anise, and cloves into the bottom of a roasting pan. 
            Place a roasting rack into the pan over the water, anise, and cloves; 
            place ham on rack. Cut 1/4-inch deep slashes 1/2-inch apart lengthwise 
            and crosswise across the top of the entire ham.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Whisk brown sugar, honey,
             mustard, vinegar, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper
             together in a bowl until glaze has a thick, smooth consistency.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brush glaze all over ham. Continue baking ham, brushing glaze on every 20 
            minutes, until glaze is deep golden and ham is heated through, about 2 
            hours 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
            should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a kitchen torch to heat the glaze on the ham until it is crispy 
            and caramelized, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
