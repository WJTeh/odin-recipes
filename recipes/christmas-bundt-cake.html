    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A great holiday ham glaze needs to have three things: wonderful flavor, 
        gorgeous, shiny appearance, and a crispy, crackling crust you can hear
         across the room. I'm happy to report this easy-to-make glaze has all those
         things in abundance.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pound cake recipe (2 separate batches: one tinted green
            and one untinted)</li>
       <li>Green food coloring</li>
       <li>2 loaf pans (I used 8½ x 4½ x 2½)</li>
       <li>Cooling rack</li>
       <li>Christmas tree cookie cutter (should be shorter than Bundt cake pan)</li>
       <li>Baking sheet</li>
       <li>1 fluted Bundt cake pan</li>
       <li>Spatula for spreading batter</li>
       <li>Icing recipe </li>
       <li>Zip-top bag or piping bag with large round tip</li>
       <li>Sugared cranberries (optional decoration)</li>
       <li>Sage leaves or rosemary sprigs (optional decoration)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Making the christmas tree</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make one batch of pound cake batter and add green food coloring. 
            I used 2 teaspoons of liquid green food coloring to get a vivid 
            bright green color. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Grease and flour two loaf pans and evenly split the green 
            pound cake between them. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake according to the pound cake directions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Immediately turn out the green loaf cakes onto a cooling rack and cool 
            for 1–2 hours. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cut cooled cake into slices as thick as your cookie cutter. I ended up
             getting about 7 slices from each loaf. </li>


        <br>
        <li>Use a Christmas tree cookie cutter to cut out a Christmas tree from each 
            slice of cake. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Immediately turn out the green loaf cakes onto a cooling rack and cool 
            for 1–2 hours. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Place all the Christmas tree pieces onto a baking sheet and chill in 
            the freezer for about 5-10 minutes. This prepares them for our next steps. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><i>Note: You will have a lot of cake scraps leftover, and a great way to use them
         is to make cake pops! Red candy melts would make a perfect holiday coating.</i></p>
    
    <h3>Assembling the Bundt Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Grease and flour your Bundt cake pan. Make a second batch of pound cake batter, 
            but do not tint it.</li>

        <br>
        <li> Add about ⅔ of the batter to the prepared Bundt cake pan.</li>

        <br>
        <li> Carefully add the Christmas trees, being sure to put them into the 
            batter upside down, as seen below, so when the cake is turned out of the
             pan, the trees will be standing the right way up.</li>

        style="width:700px; height:500px;">
        <br>
        <li> After all the Christmas tree cakes are inserted, very carefully add 
            the rest of the batter on top. It's okay if some green peeks through
             (as seen on the left side of the image below). The batter will rise 
             as it cooks.</li>

        style="width:700px; height:500px;">
        <br>
        <li>Bake following recipe instructions in a preheated 325 degrees F 
            (165 degrees C) oven for about 1 hour and 25 minutes until a toothpick
            inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake is just starting 
            to pull away from the sides of the pan. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Carefully turn out the cake onto a cooling rack as soon as it comes out of the oven.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let it rest for 2–3 hours until it's completely cool to the touch. </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Decorating the Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <img src="../images/cake-three.jpeg" alt= "Cake completed"
        style="width:700px; height:500px;">
        <li>Make the icing (see recipe link above).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Scoop icing into a zip-top bag and cut off a large corner OR scoop 
            icing into an piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe icing
             slowly over the top of the cooled cake, letting it drip partway down 
             the sides. Note: Do not pour the icing; pipe it as directed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While your icing is still sticky, add any decorations you like. 
            Sprinkles and red hots could be a very fun and festive decoration.
             Or you can go more rustic and do sugared cranberries and rosemary 
             springs as I did. </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <p><i>Enjoy the ooohs and aaahs from family and friends as they slice 
        into this festive surprise cake!</i></p>
