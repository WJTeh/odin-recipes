    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe elevates the beloved traditional pound cake with a modern twist
        that will surprise and delight your holiday guests. Classic pound cake is 
        baked in a fluted Bundt pan giving it that quintessential holiday glam —
         but the best part is the mini Christmas trees hidden in each slice.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pound cake recipe (2 separate batches: one tinted green
             and one untinted)</li>
        <li>Green food coloring</li>
        <li>2 loaf pans (I used 8½ x 4½ x 2½)</li>
        <li>Cooling rack</li>
        <li>Christmas tree cookie cutter (should be shorter than Bundt cake pan)</li>
        <li>Baking sheet</li>
        <li>1 fluted Bundt cake pan</li>
        <li>Spatula for spreading batter</li>
        <li>Icing recipe </li>
        <li>Zip-top bag or piping bag with large round tip</li>
        <li>Sugared cranberries (optional decoration)</li>
        <li>Sage leaves or rosemary sprigs (optional decoration)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour water, star anise, and cloves into the bottom of a roasting pan. 
            Place a roasting rack into the pan over the water, anise, and cloves; 
            place ham on rack. Cut 1/4-inch deep slashes 1/2-inch apart lengthwise 
            and crosswise across the top of the entire ham.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Whisk brown sugar, honey,
             mustard, vinegar, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper
             together in a bowl until glaze has a thick, smooth consistency.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brush glaze all over ham. Continue baking ham, brushing glaze on every 20 
            minutes, until glaze is deep golden and ham is heated through, about 2 
            hours 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
            should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a kitchen torch to heat the glaze on the ham until it is crispy 
            and caramelized, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
